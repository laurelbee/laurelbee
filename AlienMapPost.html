    <h1>Using Spatial Analysis Techniques for Alien Abduction Risk Mapping</h1>

    <p>Spatial analysis techniques are essential is GIS work, as they can lay the foundation for projects in many disciplines including city planning, risk management, business 
        development and so on. In spring of 2024 I created this project as part of my coursework in a class about the environmental applications of GIS with the goal
        applying spatial analysis techniques that I have learned to a lighthearted and unconventional project.
    </p>
    <p>
        I felt inspired by theoretical projects that were discussed in different GIS classes that I have taken. 
        One project idea that I heard about was a suitability analysis to determine the best places to release a deadly mycotoxin 
        in order to take out as much of the human population as possible. This was obviously inspired by the television show 
        "The Last Of Us." Another project idea was a risk analysis to determine areas that could be at risk during a zombie apocalyplse.
        After doing some light research to determine a topic, I decided to do a hazard risk analysis for extraterrestrial contact 
        after coming across the National UFO Reporting Center Website which showcases a map that includes information about self-reported 
        UFO sightings. I was intrigued had to learn more.
    </p>
    <p>The purpose of the analysis that I performed was to determine areas within the state of Pennsylvania that could be at risk of an alien contact scenario.
        Scholarly articles and popular cultural phenomena were referenced in order to choose appropriate constraints
        for the analysis. Factors that were taken into consideration included proximity to historically recorded UFO sightings, 
        mental health status, land use, and proximity to military base locations.
    </p>
    <p>
        The analysis itself was comprised of three main steps: reclassification of cell values, ranking of the cell values
        and weighted combination to determine overall rankings of areas across the state. The following criteria were considered
        and rankings were applied.
    </p>

        <img src="assets/CriteriaMatrix.png" alt="Criteria Matrix">
    </div>
    <p>
        The results of the analysis were able to show us areas with significant risk based 
        on the criteria. I marked them on a web map with pop up information about the criteria 
        and rankings.
    </p>

        <img src="assets/MapPopUp.png" alt="Web Map pop-up" />
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        
        While the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life remains unconfirmed,
        this project shows how consideration of anecdotal evidence and geographic 
        information along with spatial analysis techniques were able to be used to perform 
        a complete analysis. Although the project is meant to be more lighthearted, 
        a project like this can serve as a valuable foundation for future researchers, GIS analysts
        , and emergency management professionals by demonstrating the applications of spatial analysis techniques in risk mapping. 
        I would go as far to say that exploring playful or unconventional ideas in a project like this can showcase the 
        potential for creative problem-solving and interdisciplinary collaboration. The model produced from the study
        can act as a template for similar studies. If nothing else, perhaps the project can provide inspiration for 
        other aspiring GIS professionals.
